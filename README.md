## Description

I have been tasked to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts and react to friendsâ€™ thoughts. I haved used Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database and the Mongoose ODM.

## Development

Unfortunately due to time constaints caused by the nearing end of course date I wasn't able to fulfill all the criteria of the task. In future I want to be more careful with using the correct paths when I'm testing the API with Postman, it feels like I wasted a lot of time on small mistakes like that which could have been better utilised in doing more working. The work itself wasn't too complex as I was able to follow error messages to solutions - it was only when error messages weren't available that I struggled significantly so in future I want to write more error message coding.

## Credits

I have heavily relied on information taught through the module 18 lessons of the bootcamp; copying and then editing code from the lessons of this module to fit my needs. I initially copied over code directly from the lessons that were dedicated to Users, Posts and Comments then changed the langunage to fit my needs for this project.
